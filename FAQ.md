# FAQ

#### Why is it called "Super C"?

TLDR; Because it's a Super(set) of C.

The project had several names before. But they never stuck in my mind.
I settled on 'Super C' because I think it accurately describes the project as being a Super(set) of C.
So the name does NOT mean that it's a "super" or better version of C.

#### Do you want to change C?

NO, I don't want to change C!
C is a simple, elegant and extremely powerful language.
I don't consider C to be deficient in any way except syntactical flexibility.
However, the syntactical simplicity and stability of C has been one of it's strengths.
I do NOT consider Super C to be a better version of C, I prefer to think of it as an extension to C.

#### What is your philosophy about features?

Basically, anything useful in any other language is fair game!
Except for exceptions and garbage collection! (although many people find them useful)
I just like to have the freedom to choose from a range of syntactical options.

#### Why build, extend or promote an "unsafe" language like C

I'm not interested in following any hype train on memory safety or the "modern" way of doing things.
I just want to see the language I love, C, with a syntactical facelift.

#### Why don't you just use C++?

As a professional C++ programmer with over 20 years experience, I think I have a fairly good understanding of it's many strengths and weaknesses.

But unfortunately for me personally, over time I've found myself becoming somewhat disillusioned by it; and also found that my own personal coding and design philosophy has diverged from that of C++.

I won't say more than that, because I wouldn't be saying anything new.
